Hello! I'll keep this all formal and generic to sound more professional than I am. GingerCrate Simulator DX is open source, in that I don't mind you downloading the files, modifying them, having a look around at the code etc. That's all cool and great. There's just a couple of points to keep in mind.

1. Don't re-host this site. I did in fact make it, so I plan on being the one to host it. I'd love to see any changes you make, and if they're good even add them to the site itself!

2. There's a PayPal donation button at the bottom. Regardless of how much work you do on the site, if you take it all apart and rebuild it from the ground up... you're doing that for fun. You are not allowed to add your own ads, monetisation options, or anything else of the like.

3. I, Harry Wright, still own the Copyright for the site. Basically, it's mine. I know that sounds silly and stupid for a little project like this, but I wanted to get it in here.

I haven't licensed this under anything. I thought about GNU General Public License v3.0, but I don't want to hand over *total* control of redistribution etc. So as long as you stick to those three rules, then great! I'm not trying to scare anyone off, just cover my own back.

That's pretty much it. I'd respectfully ask that you don't change the gameplay *too* much, it took me a long time to balance and change and create, so if you want to make it again then you can go do that on your own, instead of completely re-writing this. Oh, and I mention this in a couple of comments inside the code, but... this isn't coded well. I wanted to make it work, and to at least be somewhat efficient, but I have no doubt that you, someone interested enough to come to the Git page and actually think about playing around with it could think of a trillion better ways to program this site. So go nuts, you do that, but don't blame me for bad practises. Also to any learners... you can look to this for syntax if you like, but again, the logic and practises are probably inherently flawed.

Happy nerding!
